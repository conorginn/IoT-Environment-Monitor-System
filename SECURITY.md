# Security Implementation Overview

## System Architecture & Data Protection

### Hardware & Device Security
- Changed the default Raspberry Pi password and disabled password-based SSH access
- Use SSH keys for secure remote access to the Pi
- Automatic security updates enabled on the Pi

### Data Transmission Security
- All sensor data is encrypted using AES-256 before being sent to PubNub
- PubNub channels use TLS/SSL encryption for all communications
- Implemented PubNub Access Manager to control device permissions:
  - Raspberry Pi can only publish data to the channel
  - Web server can only subscribe to receive data
  - Each device uses unique authentication keys

### Web Application & Cloud Security
- Web server runs on AWS EC2 with restricted security groups:
  - SSH access limited to specific IP addresses only
  - HTTP/HTTPS traffic allowed from anywhere
- Database (AWS RDS) is not publicly accessible
  - Only accepts connections from the web server
  - All data encrypted at rest
  - SSL required for all database connections
- Custom domain (broco.online) with HTTPS enforcement using Let's Encrypt certificate

### Application Security
- All sensitive credentials stored in environment variables
- No secrets or API keys committed to version control
- Input validation and error handling implemented in both Pi and web server code
- API endpoints include rate limiting and CORS configuration

### Data Protection
- **Data in transit**: Encrypted through multiple layers:
  - Sensor to Pi: Secure GPIO communication
  - Pi to PubNub: AES-256 payload encryption + TLS
  - PubNub to Web Server: AES-256 decryption + TLS
  - Web Server to Browser: HTTPS with TLS
  - Web Server to Database: SSL encryption

- **Data at rest**: 
  - Database records encrypted using AWS RDS encryption
  - No sensitive personal information stored

### Access Control
- Each system component has minimal required permissions
- Raspberry Pi only needs to publish data
- Web server only needs to receive and store data
- Database only accessible from web server
- Regular review of access permissions

This security implementation ensures that environmental sensor data is protected throughout the entire system - from the physical sensors to the web dashboard - using appropriate encryption, access controls, and AWS security features.
